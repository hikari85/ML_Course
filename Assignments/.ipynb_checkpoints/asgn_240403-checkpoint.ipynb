    "Sonar dataset from Kaggle is downloaded at /ML_Course/Data/Sonar.csv It has 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various conditions. and 97 patterns obtained from rocks under similar conditions. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The labels are “R” for rock and “M” for mine (metal cylinder).  \n",
