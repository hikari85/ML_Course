    "#### duckDB in Jan 2024   \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL has established itself as the tool of choice for data transformations in this vast and varied ecosystem, evidenced by being the de-facto language of choice for many data processing platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB is an in-process SQL analytics engine that is rapidly gaining popularity, evidenced by its impressive stats:\n",
    "- 1.7 million downloads per month on PyPI\n",
    "- 13,800 stars on GitHub, reaching the same interest as Postgres in half the time  \n",
    "- In a comparable two-year timeframe, DuckDB experienced the same growth in popularity as Snowflake, as reported by DB-Engines trends.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is open-source.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Benefits of DuckDB   \n",
    "1. Ease of Installation. pip installs DuckDB.     \n",
    "2. Low complexity: The absence of a server (DuckDB is just a binary) means there’s no need to deal with credentials, access control lists, firewall configurations, etc.   \n",
    "3. Universal Compatibility: With very few dependencies, DuckDB epitomizes portability — it can even run in your browser.  \n",
    "4. DataFrame Integration: DuckDB's Python library has the ability to query Pandas DataFrames. It acts as a glue between it and any systems it can't directly query, facilitating the transformation step in data processing.  \n",
    "5. Extensions: DuckDB has a flexible extension mechanism, which allows for greater flexibility, especially when reading data directly from JSON and Parquet or directly from S3.   \n",
    "6. Stability and Efficiency: DuckDB can handle workloads beyond memory limits (with some limitations). "
